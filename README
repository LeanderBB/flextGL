flextGL is an OpenGL extension loader generator.

It is a bit different than other comparable systems:

 * Bindings directly generated from opengl.org .spec files
 * Gives complete control over exposed version and extensions
 * Can optionally export core-profile-only functions.
 * Flexible python template system for source-generation
 * Very 

You need the following dependencies:

 * Python 2.7 (python.org)
 * Cheetah template engine (cheetahtemplate.org)


== Source tree =======================================================

flextGLgen.py			
  The generator script.

templates/
  This sub-directories  in here  contain the different  template sets.
  You can  add your own  template by simply  creating a new  folder in 
  there.

profiles/
  Some example profile files to give  you an idea on how to write your 
  own. 'profiles/exampleProfile.txt' contains a lot of comments to get
  you up to speed.

example/
  A (very) small C++/GLFW example  on how to include flextGL into your 
  project.
   
spec/ (generated)
  This directory is  automatically created by the script  to store the
  downloaded OpenGL .spec files.


== Usage ============================================================

You create your  loader code by writing a profile  file and passing it
to the script.

Here is what a typical profile might look like:

> version 3.3 core
> extension EXT_texture_filter_anisotropic optional
> extension ARB_tesselation_shader optional

This  requests   an  OpenGL  core  profile  and   the  extensions  for
anisotropic filtering and  tesselation shaders. Those extensions where
requested  as 'optional'. This  means that  a missing  extension won't
cause  an error.  Instead, the  programmer will  have to  check before
using  it. This  can  be easily  done  by testing  a generated  global
variable.

The profile file is then passed to the script like this:

$ python flextGLgen.py -D generated profile.txt

This  will  create  the  requested  source  code and  put  it  in  the
'generated' directory.

The  best  way  to work  with  flextGL  is  to  integrate it  in  your
Build-system. The  example file  give a very  simple example  for that
with Make.

== Generated API =====================================================

The generated API boils down to two things:

int flextInit()
  Initializes the OpenGL functions after context creation. 

FLEXT_<extension-name>
  Generated  global variable for  testing if  a specific  extension is
  supported. 

Take a look at the example program to see both in action.

== Templates =========================================================

At the moment, there are two template sets available:

'compatible':
  This loads the extensions using a framework-agnostic method with WGL
  AGL and GLX. This is  probably the sensible default for most people.
  It has not been thoroughly tested yet, though.

'glfw':
  This  uses  GLFW's functions  for  loading  and  testing for  OpenGL
  extensions.  It will  obviously only  work  with GLFW,  but is  well
  tested and the generated source code is very easy to understand.
