ExtGL is an OpenGL Extension loader generator.

It is written in Python and uses the Cheetah template engine for
generating the source files.

The generated source code will only work with the GLFW OpenGL
framework at the moment. This is because this is used for extension
checking and loading.

It should be relatively simple to create a new Cheetah template for
other frameworks or even languages, though.

Try invoking ExtGL like this:

$ python extensionGen.py -D generated profiles/exampleProfile.txt

This will download the current OpenGL specification from opengl.org
and generate the files "generated/ExtGL.h" and "generated/ExtGL.cpp".

profile/exampleProfile.txt defines the target OpenGL version & profile
as well as a list of desired extensions. Take a look at the file for
the syntax. I have also defined a few other profile files which might
be useful in the profile directory. 

ExtGL needs Python 2.x. Python 3 won't work. This is because of
Cheetah. So you may need to call 'python2' instead of 'python' if you
are using Arch Linux, for instance.

You can call 'python extensionGen.py -h' a complete list of
command-line options.

Now all you have to do is to include ExtGL.h instead of the usual
GL/gl.h and invoke the function init_opengl() after OpenGL context
creation. This will initialize all functions.

To get more information on how ExtGL's initialization mechanism work,
I suggest taking a look at the generated ExtGL.cpp. There isn't really
a lot of complex stuff going on actually.
